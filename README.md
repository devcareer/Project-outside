Project-Outside
-----

## Introduction

Project-Outside is a musical venue and artist booking site that facilitates the discovery and bookings of shows between local performing artists and venues. This site lets you list new artists and venues, discover them, and list shows with artists as a venue owner.

Your job is to build out the UI (user interface) using react and fetch the API data from the API provided to populate the UI (user interface).

## Overview

This app is has a design and an API ready. The objectives of the app are as follows:

* creating new venues, artists, and creating new shows.
* searching for venues and artists.
* learning more about a specific artist or venue.

We want Project-Outside to be the next new platform that artists and musical venues can use to find each other, and discover new music shows. Let's make that happen!
